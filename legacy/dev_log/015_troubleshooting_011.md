# Unit 15.11: Remove OpenTelemetry Dependencies from CodeRipple

**Date:** 2025-06-28  
**Status:** COMPLETED  
**Type:** Dependency Management & Runtime Error Resolution

## Problem Statement

Lambda function continues to return HTTP 500 errors due to OpenTelemetry StopIteration exceptions, even after:
- ✅ Downgrading to Python 3.12 (Unit 15.10)
- ✅ Enabling OpenTelemetry configuration (Unit 15.11 attempt)
- ✅ Setting GitHub repository owner variable (Unit 15.12)

CloudWatch logs show persistent OpenTelemetry context loading errors:
```
[ERROR] Failed to load context: contextvars_context, fallback to contextvars_context
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/python/opentelemetry/context/__init__.py", line 46, in _load_runtime_context
    return next(  # type: ignore
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
StopIteration
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Investigation: Does CodeRipple Actually Need OpenTelemetry?

**Key Discovery:** CodeRipple does NOT use OpenTelemetry directly in its source code.

```bash
# Search for OpenTelemetry usage in CodeRipple source
find ./coderipple/src -name "*.py" -exec grep -l "from opentelemetry\|import opentelemetry" {} \;
# Result: No files found

grep -r "opentelemetry" ./coderipple/src/
# Result: No OpenTelemetry usage found in CodeRipple source code
```

**Dependency Analysis:**
- **CodeRipple source:** No direct OpenTelemetry imports or usage
- **Strands SDK:** Requires OpenTelemetry as transitive dependency
- **Current requirements.txt:** Explicit OpenTelemetry dependencies (unnecessary)

### The Real Issue

OpenTelemetry dependencies in `requirements.txt` were:
1. **Not needed by CodeRipple directly**
2. **Potentially conflicting with Strands SDK's own OpenTelemetry requirements**
3. **Causing StopIteration errors in Lambda runtime**

## Solution Implementation

### Step 1: Remove Explicit OpenTelemetry Dependencies

**File:** `coderipple/requirements.txt`

**Removed dependencies:**
```python
# REMOVED - Let Strands SDK manage its own OpenTelemetry dependencies
opentelemetry-api==1.34.0
opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-common==1.34.0
opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-http==1.34.0
opentelemetry-proto==1.34.0
opentelemetry-sdk==1.34.0
opentelemetry-semantic-conventions==0.55b0
```

**Replaced with:**
```python
# OpenTelemetry dependencies removed - let Strands SDK manage its own OTel dependencies
# This prevents version conflicts and StopIteration errors in Lambda
```

### Step 2: Disable OpenTelemetry in Lambda Environment

**File:** `infra/terraform/functions.tf`

**Updated configuration:**
```hcl
# OpenTelemetry configuration - disabled because CodeRipple doesn't use it directly
# Only Strands SDK requires it, but we can disable it to prevent StopIteration errors
OTEL_SDK_DISABLED     = "true"
OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER  = "none"
OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER = "none"
OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER    = "none"
```

## Technical Rationale

### Why This Approach Works

1. **Dependency Separation:** Let Strands SDK manage its own OpenTelemetry version requirements
2. **Version Conflict Prevention:** Avoid explicit version pinning that might conflict with Strands
3. **Runtime Disabling:** Disable OpenTelemetry at runtime to prevent context loading errors
4. **Minimal Impact:** CodeRipple functionality unaffected since it doesn't use OpenTelemetry directly

### Dependency Management Strategy

**Before (Problematic):**
```
CodeRipple requirements.txt
├── opentelemetry-api==1.34.0 (explicit)
├── opentelemetry-sdk==1.34.0 (explicit)
└── strands-agents==0.1.6
    └── opentelemetry-* (transitive, potentially different versions)
```

**After (Clean):**
```
CodeRipple requirements.txt
└── strands-agents==0.1.6
    └── opentelemetry-* (transitive, managed by Strands)
```

## Expected Results

### Lambda Function Behavior
- ✅ **No more StopIteration errors** from OpenTelemetry context loading
- ✅ **Successful Strands SDK initialization** with its own OpenTelemetry dependencies
- ✅ **HTTP 200 webhook responses** instead of HTTP 500 errors
- ✅ **Proper CodeRipple agent execution** without OpenTelemetry interference

### Deployment Impact
- **Smaller Lambda package** - fewer explicit dependencies
- **Faster cold starts** - less dependency resolution overhead
- **Better compatibility** - no version conflicts between explicit and transitive dependencies

## Validation Steps

### 1. Commit Changes
```bash
git add infra/terraform/functions.tf coderipple/requirements.txt
git commit -m "Unit 15.11: Remove OpenTelemetry dependencies and disable OTel in Lambda"
```

### 2. Deploy and Test
- Deploy via GitHub Actions pipeline
- Test webhook endpoint: `curl -X POST https://API_ID.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/webhook`
- Expected: HTTP 200 response instead of HTTP 500

### 3. Monitor CloudWatch Logs
- Should see no more OpenTelemetry StopIteration errors
- Should see successful Strands agent initialization
- Should see proper CodeRipple webhook processing

## Lessons Learned

### Dependency Management Best Practices
1. **Only include direct dependencies** in requirements.txt
2. **Let libraries manage their own transitive dependencies**
3. **Avoid version pinning unless specifically required**
4. **Investigate actual usage before adding dependencies**

### Troubleshooting Approach
1. **Question assumptions** - "Does CodeRipple actually need OpenTelemetry?"
2. **Analyze source code** - Verify actual usage vs. listed dependencies
3. **Understand dependency relationships** - Direct vs. transitive dependencies
4. **Test minimal configurations** - Remove unnecessary complexity

## Integration with Previous Units

**Unit 15.10 (Python 3.12):** ✅ Still valid - Python 3.12 provides better OpenTelemetry compatibility when needed
**Unit 15.12 (GitHub Repo Owner):** ✅ Still needed - CodeRipple requires repository information
**Unit 15.11 (This Unit):** ✅ Addresses the core OpenTelemetry StopIteration issue

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Lambda function deploys successfully without OpenTelemetry dependency conflicts
- [ ] Webhook returns HTTP 200 instead of HTTP 500
- [ ] CloudWatch logs show no OpenTelemetry StopIteration errors
- [ ] Strands SDK initializes successfully with its own OpenTelemetry dependencies
- [ ] CodeRipple agents execute properly for webhook processing

**Status:** Implementation complete, awaiting deployment validation.
