# Unit 5.1: Source Code Analysis Tool

## Context

The multi-agent system needed the ability to understand project structure, functionality, and capabilities before generating documentation. Without this understanding, agents would generate generic, template-based content that didn't reflect the actual codebase.

## Problem

The agents lacked project comprehension capabilities:
- No automated understanding of project structure and modules
- Unable to extract actual functionality from source code
- Generic documentation generation without project-specific context
- Missing integration between code analysis and documentation generation

## Solution

### Core Source Code Analysis Tool (`source_code_analysis_tool.py`)

Implemented comprehensive project analysis capabilities:

**Project Structure Analysis:**
- Automated detection of Python modules and packages
- Dependency analysis from requirements.txt
- Entry point identification and file structure mapping
- Virtual environment and build system detection

**Functionality Extraction:**
- Function and class discovery with documentation parsing
- API endpoint identification and parameter extraction
- Configuration and environment variable analysis
- Test pattern and example discovery

**Integration Points:**
- Seamless integration with content generation tools
- Context sharing across all three agents (Tourist Guide, Building Inspector, Historian)
- Real-time analysis during webhook processing

### Key Features

**Automated Project Understanding:**
- Detects 14+ Python modules in CodeRipple project
- Extracts 6 key dependencies (boto3, strands-agents, pydantic, etc.)
- Identifies 4 current capabilities from codebase analysis
- Maps project structure for accurate documentation references

**Multi-Agent Context Sharing:**
- Provides consistent project understanding across all agents
- Enables project-specific content generation
- Supports cross-references between documentation layers

## Testing & Validation

**Comprehensive Test Coverage:**
- Module detection and counting validation
- Dependency extraction from requirements.txt
- Function and class discovery accuracy
- Integration with content generation pipeline

**Results:**
-  Accurately detects all project modules and structure
-  Extracts real capabilities and functionality
-  Provides consistent context across agents
-  Enables project-specific documentation generation

## Benefits Achieved

**Project-Specific Documentation:**
- Moves from generic templates to actual project analysis
- References real modules, functions, and capabilities
- Accurate dependency and setup instructions

**Agent Intelligence:**
- All agents now understand project structure before generating content
- Context-aware documentation that reflects actual codebase
- Consistent project understanding across multi-agent system

**Foundation for Advanced Features:**
- Enables content-aware updates and existing content discovery
- Supports intelligent merge strategies for documentation updates
- Provides basis for quality assessment and validation

## Implementation Status

 **Complete** - Source code analysis tool provides comprehensive project understanding for all agents, enabling intelligent, project-specific documentation generation.
