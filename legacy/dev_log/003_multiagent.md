# Unit 3: Multi-Agent System

## Context

CodeRipple needed to implement the Three Mirror Documentation Framework through specialized agents that could coordinate to provide different perspectives on code changes. This required building a sophisticated multi-agent orchestration system using AWS Strands.

## Problem

The system needed multiple specialized agents working in coordination:
- No orchestration system to coordinate multiple documentation perspectives
- Missing specialized agents for different documentation viewpoints
- Lack of intelligent agent selection based on change context
- No framework for coordinated multi-agent documentation generation

## Solution

### Multi-Agent Architecture Implementation

Implemented a complete multi-agent system with orchestration and three specialized agents:

**Orchestrator Agent (`orchestrator_agent.py`):**
- Central coordination using Layer Selection Decision Tree
- Intelligent agent selection based on change context and impact
- Webhook processing and context initialization
- Cross-agent coordination and workflow management

**Three Specialized Agents:**

**1. Tourist Guide Agent (`tourist_guide_agent.py`) - "How to ENGAGE"**
- User-facing documentation and onboarding content
- Getting started guides, usage patterns, and user workflows
- Discovery documentation and user experience optimization
- Focus: How users interact with the system

**2. Building Inspector Agent (`building_inspector_agent.py`) - "What it IS"**
- Current system documentation and architecture
- Technical capabilities, system structure, and API documentation
- Architecture diagrams and technical specifications
- Focus: What the system currently is and does

**3. Historian Agent (`historian_agent.py`) - "Why it BECAME"**
- Decision context and evolution history
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) and refactoring history
- Technology migrations and failed experiment documentation
- Focus: Why the code is the way it is

### Agent Coordination Strategy

**Layer Selection Decision Tree:**
```
1. Does this change how users interact with the system? ’ Tourist Guide Agent
2. Does this change what the system currently is or does? ’ Building Inspector Agent  
3. Does this represent a significant decision or learning? ’ Historian Agent
```

**Documentation Structure:**
- **User Layer** (`coderipple/user/`): Tourist Guide Agent output
- **System Layer** (`coderipple/system/`): Building Inspector Agent output
- **Decision Layer** (`coderipple/decisions/`): Historian Agent output

### Implementation Phases

**Phase 1: Core Orchestration**
- Implemented Orchestrator Agent with webhook processing
- Created initial Tourist Guide Agent framework
- Established basic agent coordination patterns

**Phase 2: System Documentation**
- Implemented Building Inspector Agent with system analysis capabilities
- Created system documentation structure (architecture.md, capabilities.md, tech_stack.md)
- Integrated Building Inspector with Orchestrator decision tree

**Phase 3: Historical Context**
- Implemented Historian Agent with decision tracking capabilities
- Created append-only decision documentation system
- Generated ADRs, refactoring history, technology migrations, and experiment records
- Completed Three Mirror Documentation Framework implementation

## Testing & Validation

**Comprehensive Agent Testing:**
- Individual agent testing with dedicated test suites
- Integration testing across all three agents
- Orchestrator decision tree validation
- Multi-agent coordination workflow testing

**Documentation Generation Testing:**
- Tourist Guide Agent: User documentation quality and completeness
- Building Inspector Agent: System architecture accuracy and technical depth
- Historian Agent: Decision context preservation and historical accuracy
- Cross-agent consistency and reference validation

**Results:**
-  All three specialist agents implemented and tested
-  Orchestrator Agent successfully coordinates multi-agent workflows
-  Three Mirror Documentation Framework fully operational
-  Comprehensive test coverage for all agents and coordination mechanisms

## Benefits Achieved

**Specialized Documentation Perspectives:**
- User-focused documentation through Tourist Guide Agent
- Technical system documentation through Building Inspector Agent
- Historical context and decision tracking through Historian Agent

**Intelligent Agent Coordination:**
- Context-aware agent selection based on change impact
- Coordinated documentation generation across multiple perspectives
- Consistent quality and standards across all agent outputs

**Comprehensive Documentation Framework:**
- Complete implementation of Three Mirror Documentation Framework
- Systematic documentation coverage across user, system, and decision layers
- Professional, coordinated documentation experience

## Implementation Status

 **Complete** - Multi-agent system successfully implements the Three Mirror Documentation Framework with intelligent orchestration and three specialized agents providing coordinated documentation across user, system, and decision perspectives.

**Agent Status:**
-  Tourist Guide Agent (How to ENGAGE)
-  Building Inspector Agent (What it IS)  
-  Historian Agent (Why it BECAME this way)
-  Orchestrator Agent (Coordination and workflow management)
