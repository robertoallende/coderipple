# 9.8. CloudWatch Observability & Performance Monitoring
**Goal:** Implement comprehensive monitoring and observability for production operation
**Outcome:** Full visibility into system performance, execution times, and operational health with proactive alerting

**Tasks:**
- Configure CloudWatch log groups with structured logging for Lambda function (completed in 9.2g)
- Implement custom CloudWatch metrics for execution times and performance tracking
- Set up comprehensive CloudWatch alarms for proactive monitoring
- Create CloudWatch dashboard for real-time system monitoring and troubleshooting
- Add distributed tracing for multi-agent execution flow visibility
- Configure notification channels for critical alerts

**CloudWatch Alarms to Implement:**
- **Lambda Timeout Alarm**: Alert when execution time > 14 minutes (approaching 15-minute limit)
- **Lambda Error Rate Alarm**: Alert when error rate > 5% over 5-minute period
- **API Gateway Error Alarm**: Alert on 4XX/5XX response rates > 10%
- **Memory Utilization Alarm**: Alert when Lambda memory usage > 90% of 2GB allocation
- **Cold Start Frequency Alarm**: Alert when cold starts > 50% of invocations
- **Bedrock API Latency Alarm**: Alert when AI model response time > 30 seconds
- **Documentation Generation Failure**: Alert when no files generated for valid webhooks
- **Agent Execution Time Alarm**: Alert when individual agents take > 5 minutes

**CloudWatch Dashboard Components:**
- **System Overview**: Request volume, success rates, error counts
- **Performance Metrics**: Execution times, memory usage, cold starts
- **Agent Performance**: Individual agent execution times and success rates
- **API Gateway Health**: Request patterns, response times, error rates
- **Bedrock Integration**: AI model usage, response times, token consumption
- **Business Metrics**: Documentation files generated, quality scores, repository activity
- **Resource Utilization**: Lambda concurrency, memory patterns, cost tracking

**Key Metrics to Track:**
- **Execution Performance**: Total Lambda execution time, individual agent processing time, Bedrock API response times
- **Documentation Generation**: Files generated per webhook, documentation quality scores, agent coordination efficiency
- **System Health**: Error rates, retry attempts, webhook processing success rate, GitHub API response times
- **Resource Utilization**: Memory usage patterns, cold start frequency, concurrent execution count, cost metrics
- **Business Metrics**: Documentation coverage improvement, commit-to-documentation latency, agent activation patterns
- **Security Metrics**: Failed authentication attempts, unusual IP patterns, rate limiting triggers

**Notification Strategy:**
- **Critical Alerts**: SNS topic for immediate Slack/email notifications
- **Warning Alerts**: Dashboard alerts for non-critical issues
- **Daily Summary**: Automated reports with system health and usage statistics

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All Lambda logs captured in CloudWatch with structured JSON format
- Custom metrics provide detailed visibility into single Lambda multi-agent execution
- Comprehensive alarm coverage for all critical system components and performance thresholds
- Interactive dashboard provides real-time visibility into system health and performance
- Alarms trigger appropriately on performance degradation or error conditions with minimal false positives
- Dashboard enables quick identification of bottlenecks in agent coordination or external API calls
- Notification channels deliver timely alerts to appropriate stakeholders
- Cost tracking and optimization recommendations available through monitoring data
