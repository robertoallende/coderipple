## About This Documentation

This documentation is automatically maintained by **CodeRipple**, a multi-agent system that updates documentation based on code changes. Each layer serves a different purpose:

- **User docs** help you discover, learn, and use the system
- **System docs** explain what currently exists and how it works  
- **Decision docs** preserve why things were built this way

*Documentation automatically updates when code changes. If you notice gaps or issues, please [create an issue](https://github.com/user/repo/issues).*
