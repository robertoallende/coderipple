## Recent Changes Detection

The Recent Changes feature automatically analyzes your repository's file modifications to infer feature changes without requiring manual documentation updates. This intelligent system identifies patterns in code commits and presents a summary of likely feature additions, modifications, or deprecations.

### How It Works

- **Commit Analysis**: Examines code diffs across your recent commits
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies common patterns associated with feature changes
- **Change Classification**: Categorizes changes as additions, modifications, or removals

### Developer Benefits

- Stay informed about evolving features without reading every commit
- Quickly understand the impact of recent team contributions
- Identify potential breaking changes before they affect your work

> **Note**: This feature provides inferred changes based on code analysis and may not capture all intentional feature modifications. Review the suggested changes for accuracy.
