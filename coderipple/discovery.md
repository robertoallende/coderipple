## Recent Changes Detection

### Overview
This feature automatically analyzes repository activity to identify and highlight potential feature changes based on file modification patterns. The system uses intelligent inference algorithms to detect meaningful code changes and present them in a developer-friendly format.

### How It Works
- Monitors file modifications across your codebase
- Applies heuristic analysis to determine functional changes
- Groups related changes into feature categories
- Presents a summarized view of detected feature modifications

### Benefits
- Quickly understand what features have changed without manual review
- Identify unexpected feature modifications during code reviews
- Maintain better awareness of evolving functionality across teams
- Simplify changelog generation and release documentation

### Usage
Access the Recent Changes panel in your project dashboard to view automatically detected feature modifications. Filter by time period, contributor, or component to focus on relevant changes.
