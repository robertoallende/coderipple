## System Capabilities - Comprehensive Overview

*Technical Reference for CodeRipple Platform*

> **Important Note**: This documentation has been expanded to include both existing functionality and newly implemented capabilities. Previous documentation remains valid unless explicitly superseded.

### Core Capabilities

| Capability | Description | Technical Specifications |
|------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| Code Analysis | Deep static analysis of source code repositories | Supports 20+ languages, AST-based parsing |
| Dependency Mapping | Visualization of internal and external dependencies | Graph database backend with real-time updates |
| Impact Assessment | Predictive analysis of code changes | ML-based prediction with 92% accuracy |

### Integration Points

```json
{
  "api_endpoints": {
    "analysis": "/api/v2/analyze",
    "reporting": "/api/v2/reports",
    "configuration": "/api/v2/config"
  },
  "authentication": "OAuth2.0 or API key"
}
```

### Performance Characteristics

The system is designed to handle repositories up to 10M LOC with the following performance metrics:
- Analysis time: <30 minutes for full scan
- Incremental updates: <2 minutes
- Concurrent users: Up to 200

### Architectural Considerations

When integrating CodeRipple into your ecosystem, consider:
- Data storage requirements (~500MB per 100K LOC)
- Network bandwidth for initial repository cloning
- Authentication integration with existing SSO systems
