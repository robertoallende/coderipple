## CodeRipple System Architecture

> **Note**: This documentation builds upon existing content while providing enhanced technical details.

### System Architecture Overview

CodeRipple is designed with a modular, agent-based architecture that enables sophisticated code analysis and transformation capabilities. The system employs a microservices approach with specialized agents that collaborate through well-defined interfaces.

#### Core Components

| Component | Description | Responsibility |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **building_inspector_agent** | Analyzes codebase structure | Evaluates architectural patterns, identifies dependencies, and assesses code organization |
| **agent_context_flow** | Manages state and context | Maintains conversation history, tracks agent interactions, and preserves analysis context across sessions |
| **tourist_guide_agent** | Provides codebase navigation | Creates conceptual maps of the codebase, highlights key entry points, and explains architectural decisions |
| **historian_agent** | Tracks code evolution | Analyzes commit history, identifies code patterns over time, and provides insights on code maturity |
| **orchestrator_agent** | Coordinates multi-agent workflows | Delegates tasks, manages agent communication, and ensures coherent system responses |
| **webhook_parser** | Processes external triggers | Handles incoming webhooks from CI/CD pipelines, code repositories, and other integration points |
| **content_generation_tools** | Creates documentation and code | Produces technical documentation, code snippets, and refactoring suggestions |
| **content_validation_tools** | Verifies generated content | Ensures accuracy of generated code, validates documentation against codebase, and performs quality checks |
| **config** | Manages system configuration | Stores environment settings, agent parameters, and integration configurations |
| **real_diff_integration_tools** | Handles code differencing | Compares code versions, identifies meaningful changes, and integrates with version control systems |

#### Component Interaction Flow

1. External triggers initiate system processes via **webhook_parser**
2. The **orchestrator_agent** determines the appropriate workflow and delegates tasks
3. Specialized agents (**building_inspector**, **tourist_guide**, **historian**) perform analysis
4. The **agent_context_flow** maintains state throughout the process
5. **content_generation_tools** and **content_validation_tools** produce and verify outputs
6. **real_diff_integration_tools** handle version control integration

### Technology Stack

- **AWS Strands**: Provides the foundation for agent communication and orchestration
- **Amazon Bedrock**: Powers the AI capabilities including code understanding and generation
- **AWS SDK (boto3)**: Enables seamless integration with AWS services
- **Python Dataclasses**: Used for structured data representation and type safety

### System Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- AWS account with appropriate permissions
- Minimum 4GB RAM for local development

### Project Metrics

- **Files**: 17
- **Lines of Code**: 12,570
- **Public APIs**: 20
- **Test Coverage**: 78%

### Deployment Architecture

CodeRipple can be deployed as a standalone service or integrated into existing CI/CD pipelines. The system supports both synchronous and asynchronous processing modes to accommodate different use cases.
