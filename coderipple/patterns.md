## Patterns in CodeRipple

*Enhanced documentation for intelligent documentation generation*

> **Note**: This documentation has been updated to provide more comprehensive information while preserving the original content.

### Common Usage Patterns

CodeRipple provides several powerful functions to analyze code changes and generate contextually relevant documentation. Below are the key components and their usage patterns.

#### Core Data Structures

- **`CodeExample`** - A structured representation of code examples extracted from git changes, containing the snippet, language, and context.

- **`DocumentationFocus`** - An object that determines which aspects of documentation should be emphasized based on the nature of code changes.

#### Analysis Functions

- **`analyze_change_patterns(file_paths, commit_messages)`**

  Analyzes file changes and commit messages to intelligently determine what type of documentation should be prioritized.

  **Parameters:**
  - `file_paths`: List of changed file paths in the repository
  - `commit_messages`: List of commit messages providing context for the changes

  **Returns:**
  - A `DocumentationFocus` object indicating which documentation aspects to prioritize (e.g., API reference, tutorials, migration guides)

- **`extract_code_examples_from_diff(git_diff, file_path)`**

  Extracts meaningful, usable code examples from git diffs that can be included in documentation.

  **Parameters:**
  - `git_diff`: Raw git diff content showing code changes
  - `file_path`: Path to the file being analyzed

  **Returns:**
  - List of `CodeExample` objects containing extracted code snippets with appropriate context

#### Content Generation

- **`generate_context_aware_content(section, git_analysis, file_changes, code_examples, doc_focus)`**

  Generates documentation content based on actual code changes rather than using generic templates.

  **Parameters:**
  - `section`: Documentation section to generate ('discovery', 'getting_started', 'api_reference', etc.)
  - `git_analysis`: Results from git analysis tool providing change context
  - `file_changes`: List of changed files with their modifications
  - `code_examples`: Extracted code examples from the changes
  - `doc_focus`: Documentation focus analysis results

  **Returns:**
  - Generated content string tailored to the specific code changes

### Implementation Examples

```python

# Example: Analyzing changes and generating focused documentation

from coderipple import analyze_change_patterns, extract_code_examples_from_diff, generate_context_aware_content

# Get information about repository changes

changed_files = ['src/api/users.py', 'src/models/user.py']
commit_msgs = ['Add user authentication endpoint', 'Update user model with new fields']

# Analyze what documentation needs focus

doc_focus = analyze_change_patterns(changed_files, commit_msgs)

# Extract code examples from the git diff

git_diff = """diff --git a/src/api/users.py b/src/api/users.py
..."""
code_examples = extract_code_examples_from_diff(git_diff, 'src/api/users.py')

# Generate appropriate documentation

api_docs = generate_context_aware_content(
    section='api_reference',
    git_analysis=repo_analysis,
    file_changes=changed_files,
    code_examples=code_examples,
    doc_focus=doc_focus
)
```

### Best Practices

- Run analysis functions immediately after significant commits to keep documentation in sync with code
- Use the `DocumentationFocus` output to prioritize which sections of documentation to update first
- Include extracted code examples in your documentation to provide practical implementation guidance
