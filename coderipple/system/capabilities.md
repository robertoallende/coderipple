## System Capabilities

### Core Functionality
- **Event Processing**: Parses GitHub webhook events (push, pull_request) with full payload support
- **Intelligent Analysis**: Performs sophisticated git diff analysis to categorize change types and impact
- **Orchestration**: Coordinates multiple specialist agents dynamically based on real-time change analysis
- **Documentation Generation**: Automatically generates and updates documentation files with minimal latency
- **Multi-layer Documentation**: Maintains distinct documentation layers (user-facing, system architecture, decision records)

### Recent Enhancements (v1.2.3)
- **Capability Tracking**: Implemented automatic documentation of new system capabilities and features
- **Matrix Updates**: Real-time updates to capability matrix with dependency tracking
- **Limitation Transparency**: Automated identification and documentation of system constraints

### Current Limitations
- **Trigger Mechanisms**: Currently limited to GitHub webhooks as the sole event trigger
- **Deployment Model**: Requires manual setup and configuration through the admin interface
- **Environment**: Development and staging environments only; production deployment pending
- **Agent Ecosystem**: Coordination limited to currently implemented specialist agents (see Agent Registry)

### Performance Metrics
- **Response Time**: < 30 seconds for typical changes (95th percentile)
- **File Compatibility**: Full support for all text-based files; binary files handled through metadata only
- **Concurrency Model**: Single-threaded processing with queuing for concurrent requests
- **Scalability**: Handles repositories up to 500MB with linear performance degradation
