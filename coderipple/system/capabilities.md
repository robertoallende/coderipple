## System Capabilities

### Core Functionality
- **Event Processing**: Parses GitHub webhook events (push, pull_request) with full payload support
- **Intelligent Analysis**: Performs git diff analysis to categorize changes by type, complexity, and impact
- **Agent Orchestration**: Coordinates multiple specialist agents dynamically based on change analysis results
- **Documentation Generation**: Automatically generates and updates documentation files in appropriate repositories
- **Multi-layer Documentation**: Maintains distinct documentation layers (user-facing, system architecture, decision records)

### Recent Enhancements (as of Q2 2023)
- **Capability Tracking**: Implemented automated documentation of new system capabilities and features
- **Matrix Updates**: Real-time updates to capability matrix with version control
- **Limitation Transparency**: Systematic tracking and documentation of known constraints

### Current Limitations
- **Trigger Mechanism**: Limited to GitHub webhooks only; no support for other VCS platforms
- **Deployment Model**: Requires manual setup and configuration through provided scripts
- **Environment**: Development and staging environments only; not yet deployed to production
- **Agent Ecosystem**: Coordination limited to currently implemented specialist agents (see Agent Registry)

### Performance Specifications
- **Response Latency**: < 30 seconds for typical changes (95th percentile)
- **File Compatibility**: Full support for all text-based files; limited binary file metadata processing
- **Concurrency Model**: Single-threaded execution with queuing for concurrent requests
- **Scalability**: Handles up to 100 webhook events per hour with current architecture
