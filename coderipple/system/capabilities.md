## System Capabilities - Comprehensive Overview

*Enhanced technical documentation for CodeRipple platform*

> **Important**: This documentation update builds upon the existing architecture while introducing new capabilities and integration points. Technical architects should review all sections to understand the complete system landscape.

### Core Capabilities

- **Distributed Processing Engine**: Handles parallel workloads with configurable throughput limits and automatic resource scaling
- **API Integration Framework**: Supports REST, GraphQL, and gRPC protocols with standardized authentication mechanisms
- **Data Transformation Pipeline**: Processes structured and unstructured data with configurable validation rules
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Provides comprehensive telemetry, logging, and performance metrics

### Performance Specifications

| Capability | Specification | Scaling Limits |
|------------|---------------|----------------|
| Request Processing | 10,000 req/sec | Horizontally scalable |
| Data Throughput | 500 MB/sec | Configurable per node |
| Concurrent Connections | 25,000 | Limited by hardware |

### Integration Points

The system exposes multiple integration interfaces for technical architects to leverage:

```
/api/v2/integration/webhook  # For event-driven architectures
/api/v2/data/stream          # For real-time data processing
/api/v2/admin/config         # For programmatic configuration
```

### Deployment Considerations

Technical architects should note the following deployment requirements:

- Kubernetes 1.24+ with autoscaling capabilities
- Persistent storage with minimum 5000 IOPS
- Network latency <10ms between system components
- TLS 1.3 for all communication channels
