## System Architecture

### Current Architecture Overview
The system follows a webhook-driven, multi-agent architecture:

```
GitHub Webhook → API Gateway → Orchestrator Agent → Specialist Agents → Documentation Output
```

### Recent Changes (feature)
- Update architectural diagrams with new components

### Core Components
- **Orchestrator Agent**: Coordinates agent invocation based on change analysis
- **Tourist Guide Agent**: Maintains user-facing documentation
- **Building Inspector Agent**: Documents current system state
- **Historian Agent**: Preserves architectural decisions and evolution

### Data Flow
1. Webhook event received from GitHub
2. Git analysis tool categorizes changes
3. Decision tree determines which agents to invoke
4. Agents update their respective documentation layers
