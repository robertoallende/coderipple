## System Architecture

### Current Architecture Overview
Our system implements a webhook-driven, multi-agent architecture designed for scalability and separation of concerns. The core flow follows this sequence:

```
GitHub Webhook → API Gateway → Orchestrator Agent → Specialist Agents → Documentation Output
```

This event-driven approach enables real-time documentation updates in response to code changes while maintaining loose coupling between components.

### Recent Architectural Enhancements
- Updated architectural diagrams to incorporate new microservices and data flows
- Improved inter-agent communication protocols for reduced latency
- Added observability instrumentation across the pipeline

### Core Components

#### Orchestrator Agent
- **Primary Function**: Coordinates specialist agent invocation based on intelligent change analysis
- **Key Features**: Prioritization engine, workload distribution, execution monitoring
- **Technologies**: Node.js, Redis for job queuing

#### Tourist Guide Agent
- **Primary Function**: Maintains user-facing documentation with a focus on clarity and accessibility
- **Key Features**: Markdown generation, terminology standardization, readability scoring
- **Technologies**: NLP processing pipeline, templating engine

#### Building Inspector Agent
- **Primary Function**: Documents current system state through static analysis and runtime inspection
- **Key Features**: Code scanning, dependency mapping, configuration validation
- **Technologies**: AST parsers, infrastructure-as-code analyzers

#### Historian Agent
- **Primary Function**: Preserves architectural decisions and system evolution over time
- **Key Features**: Decision logging, change tracking, architectural decision records (ADRs)
- **Technologies**: Git-based versioning, temporal database

### Data Flow Lifecycle
1. **Event Ingestion**: Webhook event received from GitHub containing commit metadata
2. **Change Analysis**: Git analysis tool categorizes changes by type, scope, and impact
3. **Orchestration**: Decision tree algorithm determines optimal agent invocation sequence
4. **Parallel Processing**: Specialist agents execute their documentation tasks concurrently
5. **Integration**: Results are consolidated into a cohesive documentation update
6. **Validation**: Automated checks ensure documentation quality and completeness

### Performance Considerations
- Agent execution is containerized to ensure resource isolation
- Caching layer reduces redundant processing for similar change patterns
- Horizontal scaling of specialist agents during high commit volume periods
