## System Architecture

### Current Architecture Overview
Our system implements a webhook-driven, multi-agent architecture designed for scalability and separation of concerns. The core workflow follows this sequence:

```
GitHub Webhook → API Gateway → Orchestrator Agent → Specialist Agents → Documentation Output
```

### Recent Architectural Enhancements
- **Updated Architectural Diagrams**: Incorporated new components and interaction patterns
- **Improved Event Processing Pipeline**: Optimized for reduced latency and higher throughput

### Core Components

#### Orchestration Layer
- **Orchestrator Agent**: Central coordinator that analyzes incoming change payloads and determines which specialist agents to invoke based on change context. Implements retry logic and maintains execution state.

#### Specialist Agents
- **Tourist Guide Agent**: Manages user-facing documentation, ensuring consistency and readability for end users. Optimizes content presentation based on change significance.
- **Building Inspector Agent**: Documents and validates current system state, including component relationships, dependencies, and configuration parameters.
- **Historian Agent**: Preserves architectural decisions and system evolution through time. Maintains decision records and links changes to requirements.

### Data Flow Sequence
1. **Event Ingestion**: Webhook event received from GitHub containing commit metadata
2. **Change Analysis**: Git analysis tool parses and categorizes changes by type and impact level
3. **Orchestration**: Decision tree algorithm determines optimal agent invocation sequence
4. **Documentation Update**: Specialist agents update their respective documentation layers in parallel
5. **Verification**: Consistency checks ensure documentation integrity across all layers

### Integration Points
- GitHub API (OAuth 2.0)
- Internal knowledge base (GraphQL)
- CI/CD pipeline hooks

### Performance Considerations
- Agent execution is asynchronous with configurable timeout parameters
- Documentation updates are atomic to prevent partial/inconsistent states
