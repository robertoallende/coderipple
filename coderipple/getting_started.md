# Getting Started with CodeRipple

*A comprehensive guide to understanding and using the CodeRipple framework*

> **Note**: This documentation builds upon existing content while providing enhanced clarity and additional details.

## Quick Start Guide

CodeRipple helps you analyze and understand codebases through intelligent agents. Follow these steps to begin working with the framework.

### Running the Core Tools

Launch any of these entry points from your terminal to start working with CodeRipple:

```bash
# Parse incoming webhook data
python webhook_parser.py

# Discover and map existing content in a codebase
python existing_content_discovery_tool.py

# Analyze source code structure and relationships
python source_code_analysis_tool.py
```

### Understanding the Agent Architecture

CodeRipple operates through a system of specialized agents, each with distinct responsibilities:

| Agent | Primary Function |
|-------|------------------|
| **Building Inspector Agent** | Examines code structure and architectural patterns |
| **Agent Context Flow** | Manages information exchange between agents |
| **Tourist Guide Agent** | Provides high-level navigation through the codebase |
| **Historian Agent** | Tracks changes and evolution of the codebase |
| **Orchestrator Agent** | Coordinates the activities of all other agents |

### Next Steps

After running the tools, explore the generated reports in the `output/` directory. For more advanced usage, see the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

## Configuration

Customize CodeRipple's behavior by modifying the `config.yaml` file in the root directory.
