# Getting Started with Coderipple

*A comprehensive guide for developers*

> **Note**: This documentation has been enhanced while preserving all essential information.

## Quick Start Guide

Coderipple provides multiple entry points depending on your use case. Choose the appropriate starting point based on your requirements:

### Entry Points

```

### Core Architecture

Coderipple is built around these essential agent modules that work together:

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|--------|
| `building_inspector_agent` | Analyzes code structure and architecture |
| `agent_context_flow` | Manages context and information flow between agents |
| `tourist_guide_agent` | Provides high-level navigation through codebase |
| `historian_agent` | Tracks changes and maintains version history |
| `orchestrator_agent` | Coordinates all agent activities and workflows |

## Next Steps

After installation, we recommend exploring the example workflows in the `/examples` directory to understand how these components interact.
