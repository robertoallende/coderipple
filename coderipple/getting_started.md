> **Note**: This documentation has been enhanced while preserving all essential information from the original content.

## Quick Start Guide

Coderipple provides multiple entry points depending on your use case. Choose the appropriate starting point based on your requirements:

### Entry Points

| Entry Point | Command | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| Content Validation | `python content_validation_tools.py` | Validate and analyze existing content |
| Webhook Processing | `python webhook_parser.py` | Process incoming webhook data |
| Content Discovery | `python existing_content_discovery_tool.py` | Scan and identify existing content in your codebase |

### Core Architecture

Coderipple is built around a system of specialized agents that work together to analyze and process your code:

#### Agent Modules

- **Building Inspector Agent**: Analyzes code structure and identifies architectural patterns
- **Agent Context Flow**: Manages the flow of information between different agent components
- **Tourist Guide Agent**: Provides high-level navigation through unfamiliar codebases
- **Historian Agent**: Tracks changes and maintains version history
- **Orchestrator Agent**: Coordinates the activities of all other agents

## Next Steps

After installation, we recommend:

1. Running a basic content discovery scan
2. Setting up your first webhook integration
3. Exploring the agent configuration options

Refer to the specific agent documentation for detailed configuration options and advanced usage scenarios.
