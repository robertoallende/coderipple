## Failed Experiment - 2025-06-15 14:33:09

**Experiment ID**: EXP-refactor_20250615_143309  
**Type**: refactor experiment  
**Commit**: abc123  
**Status**: Failed/Reverted

### What Was Tried
- Record before/after state and lessons learned

### Why It Failed
- Technical limitations discovered during implementation
- Performance impact exceeded acceptable thresholds
- Complexity introduced without proportional benefits
- User experience degradation identified

### Lessons Learned
- **Technical**: Implementation approach needs refinement
- **Process**: Earlier validation could prevent similar issues
- **Architecture**: Current design patterns more suitable
- **Team**: Knowledge gained for future experiments

### Alternative Approaches
- Consider incremental implementation
- Evaluate different technical approaches
- Gather more user feedback before major changes
- Prototype in isolated environment first

### Future Considerations
- Revisit when technology landscape changes
- Consider user feedback and requirements evolution
- Evaluate with improved technical capabilities
- Document for future reference and learning
