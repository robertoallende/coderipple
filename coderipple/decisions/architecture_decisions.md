## ADR-001: Multi-Agent Architecture

**Date**: 2025-06-14  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Commit**: abc123  
**Author**: Developer

### Context
Need to maintain documentation from multiple perspectives while respecting the temporal nature of software documentation. Different types of documentation have different update patterns and lifecycles.

### Decision
Implement role-based specialist agents using AWS Strands:
- Tourist Guide Agent: User-facing documentation with task-oriented updates
- Building Inspector Agent: Current system state with incremental rewrites
- Historian Agent: Decision preservation with append-only updates

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Clear responsibilities, appropriate update patterns, focused expertise per agent
- **Negative**: Increased complexity, requires agent coordination mechanisms  
- **Neutral**: Learning curve for AWS Strands framework

## ADR-002: Layered Documentation Structure

**Date**: 2025-06-14  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Commit**: abc123  
**Author**: Developer

### Context
Documentation needs different temporal handling patterns. Some docs need to reflect current state only, others need historical context, and user docs need task-oriented updates.

### Decision
Structure documentation into three layers based on a layered documentation approach:
- **Outer Layer (How to ENGAGE)**: Discovery, getting started, patterns, troubleshooting
- **Middle Layer (What it IS)**: Current architecture, capabilities, interfaces, constraints
- **Inner Layer (Why it BECAME)**: ADRs, problem evolution, major refactors, migrations

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Clear update patterns, appropriate depth for different audiences, reduces documentation debt
- **Negative**: Requires discipline to maintain layer boundaries
- **Neutral**: New framework may need explanation to team members

## ADR-003: Layer Selection Decision Tree

**Date**: 2025-06-14  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Commit**: abc123  
**Author**: Developer

### Context
Need systematic way for Orchestrator Agent to determine which specialist agents to invoke based on code changes.

### Decision
Implement decision tree logic:
1. Does this change how users interact with the system? → Tourist Guide Agent
2. Does this change what the system currently is or does? → Building Inspector Agent  
3. Does this represent a significant decision or learning? → Historian Agent

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Systematic agent selection, reduces redundant documentation, clear triggering logic
- **Negative**: May need refinement as we learn from real usage
- **Neutral**: Agents can overlap when changes affect multiple layers

## ADR-004: README.md Hub Generation

**Date**: 2025-06-14  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Commit**: abc123  
**Author**: Developer

### Context
Need central entry point for all agent-generated documentation. Users should be able to discover and navigate all documentation from a single location.

### Decision  
Implement Step 4A: Tourist Guide Agent generates and maintains main README.md hub that:
- Auto-discovers all documentation files in coderipple/ directory
- Creates navigation links organized by framework layers
- Shows descriptions, timestamps, and file metadata
- Updates automatically when any agent creates new documentation

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Single entry point, automatic discovery, always up-to-date navigation
- **Negative**: Adds complexity to Tourist Guide Agent responsibilities
- **Neutral**: README becomes auto-generated rather than manually maintained
