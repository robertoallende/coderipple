# React

## Project Overview

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the state of web applications efficiently.

Key features of React include:
- Declarative: React makes it easy to create interactive UIs by designing simple views for each state in your application.
- Component-Based: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
- Learn Once, Write Anywhere: React can be used to develop features without rewriting existing code, and it can render on the server using Node.js and power mobile apps using React Native.

The React repository is large and complex, with a long history of development. As of the last analysis, it has:
- 30,804 total commits
- 1,885 contributors
- 6,550 tracked files
- First commit: May 29, 2013
- Last commit: June 29, 2025 (Note: This future date is likely an error in the git history)

## Getting Started

To get started with React, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/facebook/react.git
   cd react
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   yarn install
   ```

3. Build React:
   ```
   yarn build
   ```

4. Run tests:
   ```
   yarn test
   ```

For more detailed instructions, refer to the [Contributing Guide](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html).

To use React in your project:

1. Install React using npm:
   ```
   npm install react react-dom
   ```

2. Create a new React app using Create React App:
   ```
   npx create-react-app my-app
   cd my-app
   npm start
   ```

## Architecture

React's architecture is modular and component-based. Here's an overview of the project structure and key components:

└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
```

Key components:

1. React Core: The main package containing the core React functionality.
2. React DOM: Provides DOM-specific methods for rendering React components.
3. Reconciler: Implements the reconciliation algorithm for updating the virtual DOM.
4. Renderers: Handles rendering React components to different platforms (e.g., DOM, Native).
5. Scheduler: Manages the scheduling of updates and tasks.
6. Event System: Handles event management across different platforms.

The project is organized into several packages:

- `/packages/react`: Core React library
- `/packages/react-dom`: React DOM-specific code
- `/packages/react-reconciler`: Reconciliation algorithm implementation
- `/packages/scheduler`: Scheduling library
- `/packages/shared`: Shared utilities used across packages

Other important directories:

- `/fixtures`: Contains test fixtures and examples
- `/scripts`: Build and development scripts
- `/packages/react-devtools`: React Developer Tools

## Project Evolution

React has been under active development since 2013. Recent development focuses on:

1. Flight: Server Components and related features
2. Compiler optimizations
3. DevTools improvements
4. Performance enhancements
5. Bug fixes and maintenance

The project follows a modular architecture, allowing for easier maintenance and feature development. The core team and community contributors actively work on improving performance, adding new features, and ensuring compatibility with the evolving web ecosystem.
