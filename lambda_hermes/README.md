# Hermes - The Bureaucrat

## Why am I the only component that I've a proper name?

Because naturally, the ones who do the paperwork and write the history are the ones we end up remembering.

## What I Do

I am the event logging and status tracking service for the CodeRipple analysis pipeline. I listen to all events flowing through the Telephonist (EventBridge) and meticulously record every activity in a public S3 bucket for monitoring and debugging purposes.

### My Responsibilities

- **Event Monitoring**: Listen to all Telephonist events across the entire pipeline
- **Status Logging**: Record timestamps, component names, and event descriptions
- **Audit Trail**: Maintain chronological record of all system activities
- **Debugging Support**: Provide detailed logs for troubleshooting pipeline issues
- **System Transparency**: Make pipeline status visible through public S3 bucket

### Event Log Format

```
2025-06-30T12:30:00Z | Receptionist | repo_ready | owner/repo-name
2025-06-30T12:31:15Z | Analyst | analysis_complete | owner/repo-name
2025-06-30T12:32:30Z | Deliverer | pr_created | owner/repo-name#123
```

### Architecture

- **Service Type**: AWS Lambda function
- **Trigger**: EventBridge (Telephonist) events
- **Storage**: S3 bucket for event logs
- **Access**: Public read access for transparency

I may be just a bureaucrat, but without proper paperwork, chaos ensues. You're welcome.
