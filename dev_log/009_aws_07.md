# 9.7. Performance Optimization & Testing
**Goal:** Ensure Lambda performance meets production requirements
**Outcome:** Optimized Lambda function with acceptable cold start and execution times

**Tasks:**
- Optimize Lambda cold start time through dependency management
- Configure appropriate memory allocation for agent workloads
- Implement Lambda warming strategy if needed
- Load test system with realistic webhook volumes

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Cold start time < 10 seconds for typical webhook processing
- Agent execution completes within Lambda timeout limits
- System handles expected webhook volume without throttling
- Performance meets SLA requirements for documentation generation
