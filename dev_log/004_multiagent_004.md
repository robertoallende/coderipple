# Unit 4.4: Amazon Bedrock Integration

## Context

The multi-agent system needed AI-powered enhancement capabilities to improve documentation quality, consistency, and adaptability. Amazon Bedrock integration would provide advanced content scoring, gap analysis, and dynamic improvement capabilities.

## Problem

The documentation generation lacked advanced AI capabilities:
- No intelligent content quality assessment and scoring
- Missing consistency checks across different documentation sections
- Lack of dynamic content improvement and adaptation
- No advanced gap analysis or content optimization

## Solution
