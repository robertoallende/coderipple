# Unit 7: Deliverer Implementation

**Objective:** Create the Deliverer Lambda that packages analysis results and delivers them to the Showroom, completing the CodeRipple analysis pipeline with automatic website updates and public result delivery.

## Overview

The Deliverer is the final component in the CodeRipple analysis pipeline, responsible for taking completed analysis results from the Analyst and making them publicly available through the Showroom website. It bridges the gap between private analysis processing and public result delivery.

## Architecture Integration

### Input Sources
- **EventBridge Events**: `analysis_ready` events from the Analyst Lambda
- **Drawer S3 Bucket**: Analysis results stored in `/analyses/owner/repo/commit/analysis/`
- **Repository Data**: Working copy and metadata from Drawer bucket

### Output Destinations
- **Showroom S3 Bucket**: Public analysis results and downloadable packages
- **Showroom Website**: Automatic README.md updates with new analysis entries
- **EventBridge Events**: `delivery_complete` and error events for monitoring

### Event Flow Integration
```
Analyst Lambda → EventBridge (analysis_ready) → Deliverer Lambda
     ↓
Drawer S3 (analysis results) → Package & Process → Showroom S3 (public delivery)
     ↓
Showroom Website Update → EventBridge (delivery_complete) → Hermes Logging
```

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Event Processing
- Listen for `analysis_ready` events from EventBridge
- Extract repository information (owner, repo, commit SHA)
- Validate event payload and required data
- Handle event processing errors gracefully

### 2. Analysis Result Retrieval
- Access Drawer S3 bucket with appropriate IAM permissions
- Retrieve analysis results from `/analyses/owner/repo/commit/analysis/`
- Download repository metadata and working copy information
- Validate completeness of analysis data

### 3. Result Packaging
- Create structured ZIP archive with analysis results
- Include analysis documentation and reports
- Add repository metadata and commit information
- Generate professional README for the analysis package
- Ensure consistent file structure and naming

### 4. Showroom Delivery
- Upload packaged results to Showroom S3 bucket
- Create public access URLs for direct downloads
- Organize results in `/analyses/owner/repo/commit/` structure
- Set appropriate S3 permissions for public access

### 5. Website Integration
- Update Showroom README.md with new analysis entry
- Implement newest-first ordering for analysis list
- Generate proper HTML structure for analysis items
- Preserve existing analysis entries and formatting

### 6. Event Publishing
- Publish `delivery_complete` events to EventBridge
- Include delivery URLs and metadata in events
- Handle and publish error events for failed deliveries
- Provide comprehensive logging for monitoring

## Implementation Requirements

### Lambda Configuration
- **Runtime**: Python 3.12
- **Memory**: 1GB (for ZIP processing and S3 operations)
- **Timeout**: 5 minutes (sufficient for packaging and upload)
- **Ephemeral Storage**: 2GB (for temporary file processing)

### Environment Variables
```
DRAWER_BUCKET=coderipple-drawer
SHOWROOM_BUCKET=coderipple-showroom
EVENT_BUS_NAME=coderipple-events
```

### IAM Permissions
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:ListBucket"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::coderipple-drawer",
        "arn:aws:s3:::coderipple-drawer/*"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:PutObjectAcl",
        "s3:GetObject"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::coderipple-showroom",
        "arn:aws:s3:::coderipple-showroom/*"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "events:PutEvents"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:events:*:*:event-bus/coderipple-events"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Showroom Integration Strategy

### Dynamic Analysis List Growth
Based on the planning from Subunit 6.1, implement automatic list growth:

```python
async def update_analysis_list(repo_info, analysis_path):
    # 1. Download current README.md from Showroom
    current_readme = await s3.get_object(
        Bucket='coderipple-showroom',
        Key='README.md'
    )
    
    # 2. Parse and add new analysis entry (newest first)
    new_entry = generate_analysis_entry(repo_info, analysis_path)
    updated_readme = insert_new_analysis_at_top(current_readme['Body'], new_entry)
    
    # 3. Upload updated README.md
    await s3.put_object(
        Bucket='coderipple-showroom',
        Key='README.md',
        Body=updated_readme
    )
```

### Analysis Entry Template
```html
<div class="analysis-item">
  <div class="repo-name">
    <a href="/analyses/{owner}/{repo}/{commit}/">{owner}/{repo}</a>
  </div>
  <div class="analysis-time">Analyzed: {timestamp}</div>
  <div class="analysis-links">
    <a href="/analyses/{owner}/{repo}/{commit}/">View Analysis</a>
    <a href="/analyses/{owner}/{repo}/{commit}/analysis.zip">Download Results</a>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Newest-First Ordering Implementation
- **Prepend Method**: Insert new analyses at the top of the list
- Parse README.md to find the "Recent Analyses" section
- Insert new entry immediately after the `# Recent Analyses` header
- Maintains chronological order with newest first

## Error Handling and Resilience

### Error Scenarios
1. **Missing Analysis Data**: Handle incomplete or corrupted analysis results
2. **S3 Access Errors**: Retry logic for temporary S3 failures
3. **Packaging Failures**: Graceful handling of ZIP creation errors
4. **Website Update Failures**: Fallback mechanisms for README.md updates
5. **EventBridge Failures**: Ensure event publishing reliability

### Retry Strategy
- **Exponential Backoff**: For transient S3 and EventBridge errors
- **Dead Letter Queue**: For events that fail after maximum retries
- **Partial Success Handling**: Complete delivery even if website update fails
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed error information for debugging

### Monitoring and Alerting
- **CloudWatch Metrics**: Track delivery success rates and processing times
- **Error Events**: Publish detailed error information to EventBridge
- **Hermes Integration**: Ensure all delivery events are logged
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track packaging and upload performance
