- Implement Terraform plan/apply automation with proper approval gates
- Set up staging environment for testing before production deployment
- Configure automatic rollback on deployment failures

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- GitHub Actions successfully builds and tests code changes
- Terraform deployment automated with manual approval for production
- Staging environment mirrors production for safe testing
- Rollback mechanism works correctly on deployment failures
