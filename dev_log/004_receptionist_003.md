# Subunit 4.3: Webhook Payload Parsing and Event Filtering

**Objective:** Complete the Receptionist Lambda by adding GitHub webhook payload processing, event filtering, and comprehensive task logging through EventBridge.

## Implementation Completed ✅

### 1. GitHub Webhook Payload Processing
- ✅ Parse incoming webhook payloads to extract repository information (owner, name, clone_url)
- ✅ Extract commit details (SHA, message, author) based on event type
- ✅ Handle different event types (push vs pull_request) with appropriate SHA extraction
- ✅ Validate required fields before processing

### 2. Event Filtering Implementation
- ✅ **Push events**: Only process pushes to main/master branches (`refs/heads/main`, `refs/heads/master`)
- ✅ **Pull request events**: Process opened, synchronize, and reopened actions
- ✅ **Other events**: Skip all other GitHub events (issues, releases, stars, forks, etc.)
- ✅ Proper logging for filtered events with task_completed status

### 3. Task Logging Standard Implementation
Following the Component Task Logging Standard from 000_main.md:
- ✅ **task_started**: Published when webhook processing begins with task_id, component, repository info
- ✅ **task_completed**: Published when processing succeeds (including filtered events)
- ✅ **task_failed**: Published when any step fails with detailed error information
- ✅ All events include proper EventBridge source (`coderipple.receptionist`) and detail structure

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling
- ✅ Comprehensive try-catch blocks with proper error propagation
- ✅ Task failure logging with error type, message, and stack trace
- ✅ Graceful handling of malformed webhook payloads
- ✅ Always return 200 OK to GitHub to prevent webhook retries

## Technical Implementation Details

### Event Filtering Logic
```python
def should_process_event(webhook_event, body):
    # Push events: only main/master branches
    if webhook_event == 'push':
        ref = body.get('ref', '')
        return ref in ['refs/heads/main', 'refs/heads/master']
    
    # Pull request events: opened, synchronize, reopened
    if webhook_event == 'pull_request':
        action = body.get('action', '')
        return action in ['opened', 'synchronize', 'reopened']
    
    return False  # Skip all other events
```

### Task Logging Integration
- Task ID generation: `webhook_processing_{timestamp}`
- EventBridge source: `coderipple.receptionist`
- Comprehensive event details including repository context
- Proper error categorization and stack trace capture

### Environment Configuration
- ✅ Fixed environment variable configuration using file-based approach (`env-vars.json`)
- ✅ Proper AWS CLI parameter formatting for multiple environment variables
- ✅ DRAWER_BUCKET and GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET configuration

## Testing Results

### Webhook Filtering Test ✅
- **Feature branch push**: Correctly filtered out (`refs/heads/feature-branch`)
- **Main branch push**: Correctly identified for processing (`refs/heads/main`)
- **Task logging**: Both scenarios properly logged task_started and task_completed events

### CloudWatch Logs Verification ✅
```
Sent task_started event for task webhook_processing_1751264313
Processing GitHub event: push
Skipping event type: push (for feature branch)
Sent task_completed event for task webhook_processing_1751264313
```

## Integration Points Verified

- ✅ **Input**: GitHub webhook HTTP POST requests via API Gateway
- ✅ **Processing**: Webhook signature validation, payload parsing, event filtering
- ✅ **Output**: EventBridge events (task_started, task_completed/failed, repo_ready)
- ✅ **Storage**: S3 Drawer bucket integration (existing functionality preserved)
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging with proper HTTP responses

## Success Criteria Met ✅

1. ✅ Receptionist processes GitHub push and PR webhooks correctly
2. ✅ Filters out irrelevant GitHub events (issues, releases, etc.)
3. ✅ Publishes all required EventBridge logging events following standard
4. ✅ Maintains existing repository cloning and storage functionality
5. ✅ Returns proper HTTP responses to GitHub (always 200 OK)

## Next Steps

The Receptionist Lambda is now fully functional for webhook processing. The next subunit should focus on:
- API Gateway integration for webhook endpoint exposure
- GitHub webhook registration and configuration
- End-to-end testing with real GitHub repositories
