# Unit 008: System Tuning - Subunit 001: User Onboarding Documentation

## Objective
Update the Showroom user onboarding documentation with clear, accurate webhook setup instructions to enable users to connect their repositories to CodeRipple analysis pipeline.

## Implementation

### Current Status
The existing `s3_showroom/content/howto.md` contains placeholder instructions with generic webhook endpoints. Users need specific, actionable steps to integrate their repositories with the deployed CodeRipple system.

### Technical Approach
Replace the generic howto.md content with:
1. **Accurate webhook endpoint** - Use the deployed API Gatekeeper URL
2. **Step-by-step GitHub configuration** - Detailed webhook setup process
3. **Clear expectations** - Direct users to results location
4. **Professional tone** - Improved English and user experience

### Content Updates
- **Webhook URL**: `https://1dx8rzw03f.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/webhook`
- **GitHub Integration**: Complete webhook configuration steps
- **User Journey**: From setup to results viewing
- **Results Location**: Direct link to Showroom website for analysis results

## AI Interactions
User requested specific webhook instructions based on testing results from Unit 007 end-to-end pipeline validation. AI provided comprehensive GitHub webhook setup process, which user requested to formalize in documentation following MDD structure.

## Files Modified
- `dev_log/008_tuneup_001.md` (created)
- `s3_showroom/content/howto.md` (to be updated)

## Status: In Progress
Created development unit documentation. Next step: Update howto.md content with improved user onboarding instructions.
