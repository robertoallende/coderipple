- Verify Deliverer can process Strands output correctly

#### 2.2 Repository Variety Tests
- **Small Repository** (< 1MB): Simple Python/JavaScript project
- **Medium Repository** (1-10MB): Framework-based application
- **Large Repository** (10-50MB): Complex multi-language project
- **CodeRipple Repository**: Self-analysis validation

#### 2.3 Error Scenario Tests
- Repository extraction failures
- Strands analysis timeouts
- AWS Bedrock service errors
- S3 upload failures
- EventBridge publishing errors

### Phase 3: Performance Testing
**Duration**: 1-2 hours
**Goal**: Validate performance within Lambda constraints

#### 3.1 Time Constraint Validation
- Test analysis completion within 15-minute Lambda limit
- Measure analysis duration for different repository sizes
- Validate progressive analysis phases work correctly
- Test time-aware execution and early termination

#### 3.2 Memory Usage Testing
- Monitor Lambda memory consumption during analysis
- Test with repositories of varying complexity
- Validate temporary file cleanup
- Ensure no memory leaks or excessive usage

#### 3.3 Cost Analysis
- Monitor AWS Bedrock API usage and costs
- Track Lambda execution costs
- Analyze cost per analysis for different repository types
- Validate cost efficiency compared to expected usage

### Phase 4: Quality Validation
**Duration**: 1-2 hours
**Goal**: Ensure analysis output quality and consistency

#### 4.1 Output Quality Assessment
- Validate generated documentation is comprehensive
- Test analysis adapts to different programming languages
- Verify repository-specific insights are accurate
- Ensure professional formatting and structure

#### 4.2 Consistency Testing
- Run same repository analysis multiple times
- Verify consistent output quality and structure
- Test analysis reproducibility
- Validate no random variations in core content

#### 4.3 Deliverer Compatibility
- Verify Deliverer can process Strands output
- Test Showroom website updates work correctly
- Validate download packages are properly formatted
- Ensure analysis URLs and links function properly

## Test Repositories

### Primary Test Cases
1. **CodeRipple** (Self-analysis): `/Users/robertoallende/code/coderipple`
2. **Simple Python Project**: Create minimal test repository
3. **JavaScript/Node.js Project**: Create typical web application
4. **Multi-language Project**: Repository with multiple programming languages

### Test Repository Creation
```bash
# Create test repositories for validation
mkdir -p /tmp/coderipple-test-repos

# Simple Python project
mkdir -p /tmp/coderipple-test-repos/simple-python
cd /tmp/coderipple-test-repos/simple-python
git init
echo "# Simple Python Project" > README.md
echo "print('Hello, CodeRipple!')" > main.py
echo "requests==2.28.0" > requirements.txt
git add . && git commit -m "Initial commit"

# JavaScript project
mkdir -p /tmp/coderipple-test-repos/simple-js
cd /tmp/coderipple-test-repos/simple-js
git init
echo "# Simple JavaScript Project" > README.md
echo "console.log('Hello, CodeRipple!');" > index.js
echo '{"name": "test-project", "version": "1.0.0"}' > package.json
git add . && git commit -m "Initial commit"
```
