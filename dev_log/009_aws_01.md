# 9.1. AWS Lambda Function Packaging
**Goal:** Create deployable Lambda package with all dependencies and agents
**Outcome:** Single ZIP file ready for AWS deployment with proper entry point

**Tasks:**
- Create `lambda_handler.py` with Strands agent orchestration
- Package all source code and dependencies into deployment ZIP
- Configure Lambda environment variables for GitHub integration and configuration
- Test package locally with SAM CLI or similar tool

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Lambda package < 50MB (or use Lambda layers for large dependencies)
- All agents can be invoked through single entry point
- Environment variables properly configured
- Local testing passes with mock webhook payloads


##  9.1.1. Lambda Handler Creation

    - Create aws/lambda/lambda_handler.py with basic webhook processing
    - Implement Strands orchestrator integration
    - Add error handling and logging structure
    - Checkpoint: Handler can import and initialize agents

## 9.1.2. Dependency Management

    - Create aws/lambda/requirements.txt for Lambda-specific dependencies
    - Resolve version conflicts between CodeRipple and Lambda requirements
    - Optimize package size (remove dev dependencies)
    - Checkpoint: pip install -r requirements.txt works clean

## 9.1.3. Code Integration

    - Copy/symlink CodeRipple source code to aws/lambda/src/
    - Modify import paths for Lambda environment
    - Configure environment variable handling
    - Checkpoint: All agents import successfully in Lambda context

## 9.1.4. Local Testing Setup

    - Create mock webhook payloads for testing
    - Set up local Lambda testing with SAM CLI or similar
    - Create validation scripts for agent functionality
    - Checkpoint: Lambda function processes mock webhooks locally

 ## 9.1.5. Package Creation

    - Create deployment ZIP with proper structure
    - Validate package size requirements (<50MB)
    - Test ZIP extraction and execution
    - Checkpoint: Deployable package ready for AWS

# Benefits
- Faster debugging: Issues caught at each checkpoint
- Risk reduction: Problems isolated to smaller scope
- Progress tracking: Clear milestones for project management
