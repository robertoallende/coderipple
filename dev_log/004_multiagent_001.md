# Unit 4.1: Main README Generation

## Context

The multi-agent system needed a centralized documentation entry point that would serve as the primary interface for users discovering and understanding the CodeRipple project. This README needed to reflect the current system status accurately and provide clear usage instructions.

## Problem

The existing README was outdated and didn't reflect the actual system capabilities:
- Incomplete information about project status and completion percentage
- Missing clear instructions for local usage and system operation
- Lack of accurate component listing and system architecture description
- No clear guidance on how to run and test the system

## Solution

### Dynamic README Generation System

Implemented comprehensive README generation that reflects real system status:

**Current Status Tracking:**
- Accurate completion percentage (~80% at time of implementation)
- Clear indication that system is fully functional locally
- Honest assessment of pending AWS infrastructure work
- Updated component listings with actual implementation details

**User-Focused Content:**
- Clear instructions for running the system with `python run_coderipple.py`
- Comprehensive setup and installation guidance
- Testing instructions with `./run_tests.sh`
- Practical usage examples and workflow explanations

**System Architecture Documentation:**
- Multi-agent system overview with agent descriptions
- GitHub webhook integration explanation
- AWS Strands orchestration details
- Three Mirror Documentation Framework implementation

### Content Structure
