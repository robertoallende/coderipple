### Subunit 5.2: Mock Analysis Implementation
**Objective:** Implement a mock analysis solution to enable end-to-end pipeline testing while real Strands integration is developed separately.

**Scope:**
- Repository download and extraction from S3 workingcopy
- Mock analysis engine that generates a simple README.md file
- Simulated analysis processing with realistic timing
- Mock analysis output: "This is a mock analysis for repository {repo-owner}/{repo-name}"
- Basic file structure inspection (optional metadata)
- Mock result formatting ready for S3 storage

**Deliverables:**
- Functional mock analysis pipeline
- Simple README.md mock analysis result generated
- Pipeline testing enabled without Strands dependency
- Foundation ready for real Strands integration
